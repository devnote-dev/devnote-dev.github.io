        Conceptually, Zig is entirely different to any other language that I
        have used. I don't come from a system level programming background, nor
        do I have much experience with manual memory management (and no, Rust
        does not count as manual memory management) so it feels like starting
        from scratch. Nevertheless, the language had caught my eye almost from
        the moment I properly looked at it, so I'm quite happy that it hasn't
        been a challenge to get started with. I'm still grasping onto the
        fundemental concepts of manual memory management, but Zig has helped
        with that journey thus far and I am proud of my progress.
      </p>

        That being said, Zig is still in its early days (no 1.0 release yet) and
        I have already been subject to a few reasonable breaking changes. This
        isn't really ideal when coming into the language, but I can't hold it
        against Zig, nor will I wait until a 1.0 release &mdash; who knows how
        long that will take? One of my other main concerns is with documentation
        which at present, is severely lacking. This is even true for Zig
        libraries by the community which has been the cause of long headaches
        and error messages too complex for me to understand. I hope that this
        improves over time as the language develops.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from those concerns, I have high hopes for Zig and aim to make
        good use of it in the future while growing in the systems programming
        space.
