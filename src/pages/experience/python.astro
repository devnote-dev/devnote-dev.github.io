        Python was the first language I ever learned (excluding speaking
        languages, then it's the third). I have vivid memories of playing around
        with Python 3.4 IDLE during primary school classes, not paying any
        attention to what I was actually being taught. Probably not the best
        idea in hindsight, but at least it paid off! Due to how long ago this
        was, I don't have an exact time period for the start of my Python
        journey&mdash;and subsequently my programming journey&mdash;so I will
        round it to my earliest comprehensible memories from <strong
          >2016</strong
        >.
      </p>

        This is when I started to take the language a bit more seriously,
        learning actual programming concepts, code conventions and style guides
        &mdash; I was (and still am) very opinionated about style guides. I
        explored GUI development, which until then I had only really done with
        the tkinter and turtle libraries. This prompted me to make <em>many</em>
        GUI applications doing various random and silly things purely for the fun
        of it. I didn't realise at the time, but this would be the foundation steps
        for my learning process that I have used ever since for almost everything.
        I was also very interested in the system side of things such as file system
        operations, OS services and command line interfaces. Unfortunately, I never
        really got past making basic file system operations, that would come later
        on in my journey.

        Fast forward to <strong>2018</strong> and news of my technical skills have
        circulated around my secondary school (not just programming). Surprisingly
        I was respected more because of this, and I was often asked to help students
        and teachers with various technical issues which I enjoyed doing. However,
        I still felt as if I was lacking something despite the appraisal. Was it
        knowledge? Experience? Technical comprehension? Simply put: yes; although
        I didn't know it at the time. My focus was on expanding my knowledge on operating
        systems and command line interfaces, but there is only so much a poor education
        system and hours of aimless Googling can get you. This continued into the
        following year to no avail. I was burnt out and disappointed, and with exams
        ever approaching I decided to take a break from programming altogether.

        Well, that's what I thought anyway. Turns out a very problematic virus
        had other ideas and decided to uproot everything, so I was shortly
        condemned to 2 and a half years of disassociation. During the time I had
        been frequenting various Discord servers and the concept of Discord bots
        captivated me. I had never done anything with HTTP up to this point, let
        alone hosting any kind of application &mdash; it was scary and I loved
        it. I jumped head first into the sea of Python Discord bot tutorials,
        observing different design patterns and making notes. Then, on&nbsp;
        <strong>July 17 2020</strong>, I launched my very first Discord bot. Why
        such a specific date? It's not because of nostalgic or milestone
        reasons, although I wish it were. If that date looks familiar to you,
        you're probably a software developer or technical engineer. But to
        summarise,&nbsp;

        >
          there was a Cloudflare incident
        </a>
        &nbsp;that caused a large portion of the internet to go down. Coincidentially
        this happened at the <em>same time</em> I got my bot up, so after about 5
        minutes of smooth running the connection was abruptly interrupted and all
        communication to Discord was severed. Needless to say I was startled by the
        incident which put me off doing anything with the bot for a while, but I
        eventually returned to the Discord space for round 2 which didn't dramatically
        fail without warning.
      </p>
      <p>
        As time <em>slowly</em> passed (like extremely slowly), I continued to develop
        my skills with Discord bots. I was also able to thrive in a great Discord
        community where I learned a lot of the programming fundementals I had desperately
        searched for in the previous years. I made some amazing friends that motivated
        me, were upfront with me (constructive criticism ftw) and ultimately pushed
        me past my limits. Through making and growing Discord bots I explored I side
        of programming that I hadn't really considered before: the World Wide Web&trade;.
        In all seriousness, this was the starting point for my journey into HTTP,
        websockets and various different internet protocols, and is a major driving
        factor for the work that I do today.

        At present&mdash;that is <strong>2023</strong> whenever you are reading this&mdash;I
        still use Python every so often for prototyping new ideas and concepts, and
        for when I'm working on&nbsp;

          one of my API libraries
        </a>
        . If the time comes where I need to use it professionally, I would gladly
        do so as it is a really nice language to work with.
